### Coding Tests

Most technical companies have a coding test before the interviews.

The coding test is often a Hackerrank test with **DSA/CP questions**. So preparing DSA/CP is extremely important for coding tests.

You generally have to take your laptops to the LHC for a 1-3 hour test.

Tests have 3/4 questions with multiple test cases, and you often get points based on how many test cases you pass or how many questions you solved completely.

Thus, It is advisable to submit a partially correct solution rather than not submitting one.

Apart from DSA questions, some companies also ask questions related to C++/Python involving things like predicting the output, MCQs, etc (mostly around OOPs). Some companies also ask questions about core concepts like Computer Architecture and Networks in the hackerrank tests.

#### Difference between DSA coding tests and CP

They are similar but, in my opinion, also very different. CP is a sport built around DSA, while the core concepts(DSA) are helpful both for intern tests and CP contests.
In my opinion,
**Intern Prep = DSA prep $\neq$ CP prep**

You don't need to have a high CP rating to crack these tests(a high rating can help indirectly).

CP contests are often more complex and mathematical and use many concepts which intern tests never target.
*So focus on the things that intern tests focus on instead of blindly giving contests/practicing on CP platforms; CP preparation is a long-term thing, and intern prep should be a short-term focused thing*

CP contests are an excellent way to timed practice, and seeing your overall progress compared to others and CP questions is a good way to practice slightly difficult problems.

Most companies don't care about your CP rating unless you are above Candidate Master or have done exceptionally well in ICPC.
You can have a high CP rating and not do well on their tests (you don't get shortlisted.)

PS: With increasing competition, the best companies have shifted to asking CP-type questions.
 
### DSA Resources

- [InterviewBit](https://www.interviewbit.com/)
    In my opinion, the best resource is to practice topic-wise questions thoroughly, focussing on the essential topics. Coding test questions are often just variations of the questions from here.
- [LeetCode](https://leetcode.com/)
    I recommend practicing medium/hard questions from here.
    Also, a great place to find past questions. Again coding test questions are often variations of the questions from here.
- [Codeforces](https://codeforces.com/)
    The best site for giving timed/rated contests and practicing past CP questions. Some companies pick questions from here directly. (Keep in mind the discussion on CP vs DSA above)
- [CP Algorithms](https://cp-algorithms.com/)
    Great site to get an idea about different Data Structures and Algorithms
- [CSES](https://cses.fi/problemset/)
    Great problem set of slightly difficult CP-type questions, and the accompanying book is also great

- Virtual Functions
- Encapsulation
- Abstract Classes and Interfaces
- Garbage Collection and final keyword

### General Tips

- Practice similar questions sparingly. Read about a topic and practice questions around it till you get familiar with it
- Make sure you are comfortable with C++. Some companies only allow you to code in C++
- Make sure you practice without Code Completion since coding platforms don't provide code completion hints
- Coding tests are a timed thing, so ensure that you type fast enough
- Sometimes questions have partial points, so don't hesitate to submit partially correct solutions
- Copy-pasting to the HackerRank is often disabled, so practice accordingly. (templates might not work)
- Don't focus on the advanced data structures and algorithms used in CP instead, focus on practicing different variants of the standard things
