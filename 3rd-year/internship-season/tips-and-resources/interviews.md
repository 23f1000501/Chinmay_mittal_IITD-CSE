### Interview Tips

- Dress formally, be on time. These things matter ! You won't get rejected because of these things but they make a difference. For eg. greet the interviewer when you enter
- Communication is Key ! You might know everything but if you can't communicate well, that leaves an horrible impression
- Think out loudly ! Don't blurt out answers directly. The interviewer doesn't care about you giving correct answers as much as he cares about evaluating your thought process
    * Repeat the problem once to make sure you understood it correctly
    * Ask for clarifications / assumptions if not made clear enough by the interviewer
    * Break down the problem and discuss what you are thinking with the interviewer
    * Try to evaluate and see whether the interviewer seems impressed with the direction you are going in
    * Approach the problem incrementally. Eg. For a DSA problem start with the brute force solution and optimize the algorithm incrementally
- Think before you speak and speak clearly and at a normal pace. Don't rush and be loud enough
- Make sure you are looking at the interviewer or the paper in front of you. Don't get lost in your thoughts, shake your legs etc.
- Tell the interviewer that you are thinking and need some time. Don't leave the interviewer in awkward silence
- In case the interviewer asks you questions about a topic that you don't have a clue about and it is simply impossible for you to think about a solution there be frank with the interviewer and let him know that you don't know. For eg. If the interviewer is asking you technical questions related to Operating Systems you can let him know that you haven't studied Operating Systems
- Sometimes interviewers ask tough questions and are not really looking for answers but just want to see your thought process and your behaviour. Don't sit silently and discuss possible solutions with the interviewer, interviewers often give a lot of hints
- If you are coding in front of the interviwer, explain what you are doing while coding. Code neatly (think about variable names etc.)!
- Prepare to answer technical questions about your CV or explain projects in your CV beforehand
- Prepare answers to standard questions before hand
    * Introduce yourself
    * Why do you want to join this role?
    * Why do you want to join this company?
    * Tell me a little about your experience in ML/Trading etc.
