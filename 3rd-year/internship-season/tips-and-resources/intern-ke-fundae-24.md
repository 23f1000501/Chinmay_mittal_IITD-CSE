### Hemang Sidana (Quadeye, Gurgaon)

- **Preparation Resources**:
  - Use standard resources like Leetcode, GeeksforGeeks (GFG) Sheet, and Codeforces. While Codeforces might not always be directly relevant to company tests, some companies do ask higher difficulty questions (1900-2000 rating), but mostly Leetcode-type questions are more common.
  - Cycle through different resources (e.g., Leetcode, Codeforces) to avoid getting bored. This variety helps keep preparation engaging.
  - Utilize specific guides like "50 Challenging Problems," "Heard on the Street," and "Brainstellar" for advanced problem-solving and quantitative analysis.
  - Focus on your approach to solving questions. Common reasons for not solving a problem include incorrect application, misunderstanding the algorithm, or poor implementation. Improve your implementation skills with regular practice.
  - For algorithms, observe and categorize problem types. Keep a notebook of challenging problems and practice them targetedly.
  - Daily practice should be structured. If you encounter repeated questions, analyze what you learned and document it for the next day. This keeps your preparation on track and prevents boredom.
- **CV Preparation**:
  - Start with a basic CV structure and focus on course assignments and core projects. There is no need to feel inferior; shortlisting often depends more on test performance and CGPA.
  - Ensure you only include assignments and projects you are thoroughly familiar with and can explain in detail during an interview.
  - Minimal extracurricular activities and positions of responsibility can still make for a strong CV if it highlights your academic and project strengths.
  - Pay close attention to CV aesthetics and content. Make sure your mathematical and analytical background is well-reflected.
- **Fundae**:
  - Do not list any project or assignment on your CV that you cannot explain comprehensively if questioned during the interview.
  - When choosing companies, prioritize based on either reputation or stipend. For example, Google and Microsoft may offer lower stipends but are highly reputable.
  - Avoid overapplying to companies, as you may end up with too many interviews to manage effectively. On Day 1, you can only give a limited number of interviews, so choose wisely to avoid wastage.
  - Apply to a sufficient number of companies to ensure backup options, and convey your approach during interviews. If you cannot solve a problem completely, be prepared to share your partial approach.
  - Quant firms generally offer higher compensation but come with more workload, depending on your efficiency. The workload can be more intense compared to software development roles.
  - Remember, deserving candidates might not always get into their preferred company. Don't get demotivated; accept the best opportunities available.
  - If asked about your next company interview, mention a less preferred company to keep your top choices confidential.
  - Test schedules can be hectic, sometimes running from 8 PM to midnight. Be prepared for intense scheduling.
  - Before Day 1, companies like JS and Optiver may have multiple interviews and tests. For example, Quadeye offers a direct interview on Day 1 if you clear the scholarship test.
- **Interview Strategy**:
  - If a problem is tough, break down your approach and share it, even if you don't reach the complete solution.
  - Demonstrate your mathematical background clearly during interviews.
  - For companies like Quadeye, clearing preliminary tests can lead directly to interviews on Day 1.
  - Regular practice and refining your approach to problem-solving are crucial. Keep track of your progress and make sure you can articulate your thought process during interviews.
