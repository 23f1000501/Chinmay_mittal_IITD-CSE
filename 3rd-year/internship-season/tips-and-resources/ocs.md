### OCS Tips

OCS peeps can give you a tough time during the internship season so somethings to keep in mind:

- Only apply to companies you want to go to
    * If you get offers on a particular day, you have to select one of them and cannot sit for the remaining companies from next day onwards
    * You have limited applications, don't waste them and think before hand
    * Make a rough list of companies you want to go to, to get an idea of how many application you will end up using
    * Many companies have tests/interviews on the same day, applying to many companies means giving many tests and hence not doing well in most tests due to fatigue
    * Fill the LAF (Leave Application Form) in case you miss tests
    * Pro Tip (not recommended): If you end applying for a company and you don't want to go there you can always screw up the test/interview
- You can give limited number of interviews on a particular day.
So lets say you can give 5 interviews and you were shortlisted for 6 companies, 5 of which are tough and one is relatively easy and you fill the easiest company 6th in preference, in case you don't get selected in the first 5 then you can't give the 6th interview and would have to sit for the next day so keep that in mind
- PPOs through OCS intern season affect placements next year
    - If you accpet the PPO, you can't sit for placements
    - If you reject the PPO given by a Day x company, you can only sit for Day x and before
    - If you don't get the PPO you can sit for all days
- You can use different CVs for different roles, the exact role you use to submit the CV doesn't matter.
Eg. you can submit a consulting CV (tailored for Deep Learning) to a Deep Learning role and the company wouldn't know that you submitted a Consulting CV
- There can be a lack of charging points / internet congestion in LHC during offline tests. Take your own extension cords and recharge your mobile data
- Keep track of the OCS portal for last minute change in test / interview timings
- Sometime interviews go longer than scheduled so contact OCS peeps to make sure you don't miss interviews
- Contact OCS to ensure you don't have any clashing tests / interviews
- Don't forget to fill the preference order before each interview day
- OCS fines are a real thing, so be careful
