## Summary of Internship Test Tips and Experiences:

### 1	Dhruv Tyagi (Quadeye Quant Tesearch CS1):
-	Did Quant as he found Quant prep resources more interesting than tech (*Interivews and actual work in interns differ a lot but are a good way to get a rough idea of what interests you*).
-	Focussed on quant-related topics
-	Resources he followed for Quant
    - [Brainstellar](https://brainstellar.com/)
    - [50 challenging problems on probability](https://mbapreponline.files.wordpress.com/2013/07/fifty_challenging_problems_in__2.pdf)
    - [Herd on the street](https://www.amazon.com/Heard-Street-Quantitative-Questions-Interviews/dp/0994103867)
-	Jane Street is challenging to crack and interviews have difficult Olympiad type probability puzzles
-	CG cutoff for Quadeye was 8.5+
-  Most good quant companies have a CGPA cutoff of 8+ 
-	Stay confident in interviews (*knowing things and doing well in interviews is very different*)
    - Prepare for standard interview questions in advance
    - Do mock interviews
    - Be clear and confident while speaking
    - Don't stutter and also don't speak very quickly
    - Interact with the interviewer don't make it a monologue
-	Maintain a good balance and stay healthy during the exhausting two-week of tests.
-	Internship was focussed on researching on how financial news can affect markets. Involves coding in R for data science and experiments.
-	Working hours are 9:30 am to 7 pm but most people stay till 8 pm
    - Since everybody wants a PPO most people put in the extra effort
-	If you apply and donâ€™t give the test fill the LAF (Leave Application form)
-	Donâ€™t focus on just a few companies keep all options open
    - Don't prepare for just one/two companies, you might just have a bad day
    - Don't prepare for too many companies, it becomes exhausting giving all tests
-	In conclusion donâ€™t apply for few companies as you might have a bad day so keep safer options open too, also donâ€™t apply in too many companies as you won't be able to manage your time.


### 2	Vidushi Agarwal CS1 (Google India SDE):
-	Be clear about the type of company you want to join.
-	Important topics for SDE coding tests
    - Dynamic programming
    - Graph algorithms
    - Bit manipulation
    - Binary search
-	LeetCode medium and easy problems are sufficient, tackle hard problems later
    - Don't do too hard problems it can be demotivating
    - Also don't waste time on doing too easy problems
-	If you have a rating between 1600-1700 rating on CF its good enough to clear rounds easily. (*having a good rating doesn't directly mean you qualify tests neither does it help much in the shortlisting it justs indicates that your prep is good enough*)
-	CV should highlight relevant projects according to the role.
-	For Devlopment Profile you can show course projects like Processor Design in COL216 / Compiler Design in COL226
    - Projects are not an important deciding criterion for shortlisting 
    - They mostly become a talking point in the interview round
-	For ML profiles add ML projects in CV
    - **Tip**: you can make different CVs for different roles on the OCS portal
-	ECA and PORs don't matter much in tech roles
-	Explain your approach from scratch in interviews and gradually switch to optimal solutions.
-	Mock interviews and CV reviews from seniors are helpful.
