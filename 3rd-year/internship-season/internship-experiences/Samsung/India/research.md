- The good thing about this internship is work-life balance
- Being an online internship, there is very little work (5-6hrs weekly)
- I am working on an interesting project with the AR vision team, sadly cant share the details of my project due to non disclosure agreement.
- For PPO there is a test that take place in offline mode (in the 1 week offline period).
- You have to pass the test to be eligible for PPO.
