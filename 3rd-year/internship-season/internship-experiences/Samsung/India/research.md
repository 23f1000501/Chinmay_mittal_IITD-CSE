- The internship happened to be 7 weeks online + 1 week offline. We weren't told that it will be online.
- The starting 2 days were pretty booring. We had long online meetings for onboarding procedures.
- The only good thing about this internship is work-life balance. 
- Being an online internship, there is very little work (5-6hrs weekly). I don't feel like learning something new in the internship. Its just that I have a lot of time for myself.
- I am working on an interesting project with the AR vision team which is related to predicting the boundaries of hand and object(in the hand) from a 2-d image in 3-d space.
- If someone is interested in acquiring the PPO, next few points are for them.
- For PPO there is a test that take place in offline mode (in the 1 week offline period) .
- You get second chance to give the test if you fail in the first one.
- You have to pass the test to be eligible for PPO. i.e. The test is just one of the step that needs to be cleared for getting the PPO.
