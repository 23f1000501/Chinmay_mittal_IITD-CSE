- The internship program is for 9 weeks. 
- These were divided into 8 weeks of Project Work and Algorithms Training Activites, followed by 1 week visit to Samsung HQ in Korea. 
- Initially as per the offer letter the internship was supposed to be in Korea for all the 9 weeks. However, in April, we were informed that the first 8 weeks would be ""Work From Home"" , and the last 1 week would be a visit to Korea where we would visit the HQ , talk with the mentors, have an interview for placement offers and a programming test. 
 
 
 
- Samsung Electronics has 5 broad divisions, we were provided information and possible roles in each division and were asked to list our preferences. 
- I was assigned the VD (Visual Display Unit), this involves work related to AI and Big data focussed on Samsung's Visual devices. This, however, was not my preferred division.

- The first 2 weeks were for training purposes to enhance our problem solving skills. We had to see some lectures regarding Algorithms on Samsung's professional training portal. Most of the stuff was like ADA, but some extra things were there too. Other than that we had to solve 2-3 CP problems daily. This was pretty much it, workload was very low. I did not find this very interesting particularly.

- For the next 6 weeks we were assigned one mentor to each student from the unit the person is supposed to work on. We were told details about projects. 
- My project was related to Computer Vision . It involved building a pipeline using MediaPipe for the purposes of exercise recognition. The aim was to recognise the exercise performed by the subject and count the no. of repetitions.

- In these 6 weeks we were also supposed to solve 1 professional coding problem daily on Samsung's portal.
-  These problems were interesting and were different from normal CP problems. They were heavy on implementaion and were intended to build efficient programs to implement a software feature.

- We were provided weekly goals and had to report to our mentor the progress after each week. During the week we could do work flexibly. 

- I found the work culture to be pretty relaxed and  my mentor was very supportive and helped by promptly whenever I needed. The HRs were also very nice and accommodative. 

- Overall, I did feel a bit unmotivated and bored during the internship duration since I was not working from an office environment with fixed hours, had very little interaction with people in the company and other interns.
