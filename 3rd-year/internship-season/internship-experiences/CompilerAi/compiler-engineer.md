- This is a startup by an IIT Delhi professor, Prof. Sorav Bansal, but the application process is through OCS. We work in the Cloud Computing Lab of SIT, although there is a proper office space in the research building. 

- The work culture is quite good, Sorav sir is quite helpful and very open to helping he interns. I can easily reach out to him anytime. It's also a great learning environment, as we get to experiment hands-on on a large codebase.
- We have to put on multiple hats of frontend as well as backend developers and what is good is that any work we do is straightaway brought into production and useful for the company, which is a great feeling. 
- Further the work is highly technical (I am currently working on designing an Intermediate Representation (IR) langauge) and involves a mixture of software engineering, compilers knowledge and in general design smarts. 

- One may perhaps feel the lack of a clear distinction between work life and personal life on campus since work is on campus itself. But then being on campus in itself provides you perks like cheap accomodation and food as well as other entertainment of being in and around Delhi.
