I am in the Corporate and Investment Banking division of the firm, in the Counterparty Credit Risk-Quantitative Research team. 

Our team develops and backtest mathematical models to mitigate the risk of credit exposure if any counterparty defaults in future.

I have been assisting my team in various BAU projects. The work life balance is pretty good here.

We only work during office hours. Overtime and work from home is strongly discouraged here.

The office has a typical corporate vibe. Every intern has their own workstation consisting of two monitors.

The office also has caffeteria, breakout rooms, TT tables, etc.
