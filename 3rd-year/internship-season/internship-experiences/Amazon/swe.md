I'm in Seller and Fulfillment org.

The project I am working on is a part of a larger project that the team is working on.

My work mainly involves working on AWS architecture of dashboard. Some of the AWS services I use are SNS, SQS, Lambda, DDB, Cloudwatch, Quicksight and Crawler. I find these stuff interesting.

For interns, the workload is not much. There is also constant help from the mentor and also the team. There are weekly 1-on-1s with mentor and manager.

The work environment is good. Even though there is much work for permanent employees, it's not toxic.
