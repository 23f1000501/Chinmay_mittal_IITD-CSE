Mine was backend role where I had to make a distributed job scheduler. So the project involved both research work and implementation.

The work life balance was really good, the company is really flexible with the work hours and mainly cares that the work is done on time and not that you have to be online the whole time even if you don't have any work. Working on weekends was also discouraged. 

Work environment was also really good. The company gives complete freedom whether you want to work from home or from office. All the people in my were really helpful and the Manager was also very supportive.
