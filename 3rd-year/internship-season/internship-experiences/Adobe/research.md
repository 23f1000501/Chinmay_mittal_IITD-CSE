**The Project**: The project on the face value was not very interesting, but still provided many opportunities for ingenuity. Was fun working with mentors and people in the domain that have papers etc. in various conferences. 

**Work Life balance**: no strict office hours, even meetings could be attended remotely as well. 

**Environment**: Very nice culture, most amenities are best in class including gyms, music rooms, cafeteria etc. Food was free, both at lunch and dinner. 

Over-all good, but do not have much expectations for PPO, since there are very less slots. Will update this part at the end of the internship.

Project - Cost Optimization for LLM usage

Work can be hectic depending on your mentors. Overall lot of scope for balance if you're good. Company environment is really good. Perks like relocation bonus, lunch and dinner provided and overall employee friendly.
