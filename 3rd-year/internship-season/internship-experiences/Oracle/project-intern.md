### Data Science Project

Exploring Large Language Models (LLMs) and Instruction Fine Tuning for Question Answering using LLMs.
As part of the Oracle Digital Assistant Team, I had to work around using LLMs to answer questions over documents. I was assigned latest research papers to get ideas from. The work involved some prompt engineering and training of LLMs. It was remote internship though this may not happen in the future. There was no fixed time for working and the workload was more of capability linked.
