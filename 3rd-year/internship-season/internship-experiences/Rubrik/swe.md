- Project is more or less based on systems coding. 
- Work life balance is pretty balanced and there are a lot of things to do in office too (like playing TT, chess, fruzz ball) and there is an inbuilt Barista corner where you can drink anything of your choice, anytime of the day.
- Lots of food always available in form of breakfast, lunch, snacks, dinner along with Live Chef cooking.
- For work everyone's given MacBook Pro along with which you have 2 large monitors to connect to (effectively giving you 3 screens to work).
