### Project / Work Life Balance
- I don't know how much I can share about the project, but I'll provide a brief overview. 
- Primarily the work till now has been based on R (programming aspect), and we have been working on large datasets, trying to analyze patterns in stock market prices related to news events.
- We are divided into 6 groups of around 8-9 people each, where the project I am currently working on is part of a subgroup of the original group with 5 members.
- We have daily meetings with our mentors to give updates regarding our work that day. They're kind and helpful in general, guide us properly on the work to be done each day, and help us figure out how to improve our findings or give us some new stuff to try out.
- The work-life balance is okay only if you're enjoying the work. 
- We have a daily task list we should complete as soon as possible. When I finish the tasks that day, I optimize my code to run faster, and we can try it on slightly differing variations or parameters. 
- The work is related to real-life stock market prices, so one feels the urge to analyze the data increasingly, looking for patterns and trying to make new strategies to use best the patterns we are trying to find.
- The official office timings are around 9:30 to 7, but I rarely leave before 8.
- It's not that you are asked to leave early- I wish to better my results and look for non-trivial patterns in the data. 
- We will soon develop strategies to test (and use) in real-life market scenarios. This makes us work more than required (read as overtime) so that we progress quickly (and test/deploy our strategies :))
- The progress on our project has been significant so far. I am working independently from my fellow group members. Still, we discuss our strategies and common methodology results with each other, looking for constant improvements.
- No one in the office forces us to do something throughout the day. Still, we have some expectations for our daily meeting with our mentors.
- I have lunch around 1-1:30 pm and take breaks to play table tennis and occasionally pool. The office always has munchies and coffee machines for a snack and is otherwise pretty comfortable. Other than that, I try to separate my personal and work life by keeping my phone on silent and inside the shelf on my table to avoid all distractions.

### After Work / Weekends
- Returning to the hotel, I have dinner, watch some YouTube/series, or get some college-related work done. I sleep as early as possible and get as much rest as possible, as I feel exhausted when I come to my room. I try to sleep by 12-1 and wake up by 8-8:30.
- Weekends are when we hang out and enjoy as much as possible. Right now, we feel idle and slack, so we make the best use of that time by researching some papers related to office work or going to malls for movies/food. Gurgaon is an excellent city in that regard.
