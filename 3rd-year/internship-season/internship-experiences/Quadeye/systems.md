The intenrship experience was nice, got to learn a lot. My project involved working with TCP, UDP posix sockets in C++ and creating a reflection system for C++. Work environment was good with a lot of freedom. Generally I spent 10 to 11 hours in office. There were weekly tests, so apart from office time, some time was spent to study for them as well.
