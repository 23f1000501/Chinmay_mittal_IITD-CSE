#### Project

- My project is on Adaptive Timeouts which is related to dynamically modifying timeout values for requests which take a longer time to be serviced due to failure of the service/API ahead. 
- I have to implement the CoDel (controlled delay) algorithm for the same.

#### Perks
- Uber's office at Bangalore is a very amazing place. 
- There is absolute flexibility in where you want to sit while you work, the cafeteria, couches, swings or proper desks. 
- Pool, TT, gym, nap rooms etc are present for employees' recreation and entertainment.
- The cafeteria is full of food , milkshakes, juices, chips, fruits, yogurt, cookies, cakes, chocolates, dry fruits (basically anything and everything you can imagine ;). 
- Breakfast, lunch and snacks are provided to all employees in office free of cost. 

#### Work Life

- It is mandatory to come to office only on 2 days, Tuesday and Thursday.
- Rest it is on the employees whether they want to work from home or report to office.
- Most people come to office before 11:30 and leave by 5 - 5:30, again flexible.
- The managers and team just want work to be done, be it from anywhere.

- Work environment is awesome too. All my teammates are extremely cooperative and helpful and always try their best to help whenever I go to them for any doubt.
- I have meetings with my mentor every Tuesday and Thursday to discuss workflow and report my progress. 
- Overall work culture at Uber is excellent with ample time for other activities.
