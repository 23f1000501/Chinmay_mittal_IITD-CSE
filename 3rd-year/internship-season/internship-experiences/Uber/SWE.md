# Uber Internship Experience

## Program Duration
- The Uber internship program spans 8 weeks.
- After a few months of selection, we received a package of goodies from Uber, including a bag, mug, diary, laptop stand, and more.

## First Day
- On our first day, we were thrilled to receive our assigned laptops.
- Almost everyone at Uber works on Mac machines (both Intel and Apple Silicon chips are used)
- As interns, we were also given MacBooks and were promptly set up for us.
- We were explained the culture at Uber and the values which the company and it's employees abide by.
- Moreover, we had met several leaders who have been in the industry for a long time and now head various teams within the organization.
- Later in the day, we had the opportunity to connect with our mentors and managers.

## After Day One
- Unlike some other companies where the initial weeks are dedicated to common training for all interns, at Uber, we dive right into working alongside our mentors and managers.
- Of course, we had some self-paced courses to complete on our own schedule.
- The people here are smart and approachable. They understand what their roles are and the impact they have on the company as a whole.
- My mentor has been incredibly supportive, interactive, and provides excellent guidance.
- The learning curve here is steep as we delve into various computer science and engineering principles, understanding how Uber implements them internally within their own tools.
- Our task is to grasp these tools and leverage them effectively within our own projects.
- The projects assigned to us are not mere simulations; they are either new projects that will be deployed upon completion or existing projects where we contribute in meaningful ways.
- In my case, I'm building a command-line tool that interacts with internal databases at Uber, fetching and processing valuable information to aid engineers in resolution of storage problems.

## Work-Life Balance and Office Environment
- Work-life balance is nice here.
- People arrive usually arrive between  9 - 11:45AM and leave at around 4-5:30 PM depending on the weather.
- Some even have the flexibility to work from home.
- The office environment is amazing, with a well-stocked pantry offering snacks, beverages, coffee machines and much more.
- There's even a dedicated wellness room where you can take naps.
- Additionally, there are recreational activities available, including air hockey, table tennis, billiards, PlayStation, drums etc.
- We are also provided with breakfast, lunch, and evening snacks in the office.

The Uber internship experience offers meaningful work, supportive mentors, a balanced lifestyle, and an enjoyable office environment and has been great so far.
