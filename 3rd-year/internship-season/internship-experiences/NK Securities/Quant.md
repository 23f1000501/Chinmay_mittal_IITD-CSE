# Internship Review

## Office 

The office of NK Securities is in Gurgaon. We are a small team - 26 Full Time Employees (additional 20 will be joining this season), and 13 interns. The office has a pantry, where we can find stuff to eat and drink (Chips, Biscuits, Dry Fruit, Soft Drink Cans, Fruit Juice and a lot more - typically everything you would find in IITD shops).

Being a small team, everyone is connected. You can ask anything to any of the seniors. Most (almost all) seniors are from IIT Delhi, so you can resonate more. Every senior has a clear idea about the stuff they are doing, and that vision helps you learn too. You would also find founders working in office too (though in a separated room).

Office hours are from 8:45 AM to 6 PM. These are strict. You would typically find people working after 6 too. After 6, you are free to leave whenever you want.  ~~I usually leave at 6 though~~ ðŸ˜‰

## Accomodation

We are provided accomodation by the company (It is just walking distance from the office). Breakfast and dinner are included in the hotel, while the lunch is provided in the office. Other than that, we get fruits and snacks in the evening in the office itself.

## Other things

We have weekly football game - every Friday - where everyone interested can play. Founders play too - so that's a good opportunity to interact with them. There is a monthly party on the last Friday of every month - in one of the clubs/bars in Gurgaon. (This party was really nice)

## My own experience

My overall experience is good. Since it is a small company, there are a lot of new things that are still to be tried and you get an opportunity to try them out yourself. The best thing I like here is that I can propose new ideas and we can test them out as a strategy. There will be good discussions regarding pros and cons and you'll be allowed to work independently on that stuff. I am currently working on a strategy that hasn't been tested yet, and this is a great feeling and learning.
