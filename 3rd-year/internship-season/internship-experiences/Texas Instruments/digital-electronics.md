Work Environment: Work environment is decent with a dedicated playing facility called Texins which has pool,TT,basketball,lawn tennis, badminton,football in sports. It also has a gym and a music room and other games.There are 2 cafetarias-one for each building but they are paid (although nominal). Overall the work environment is decent.

Work-life Balance: The work life balance is very good as usually employees come to office at 10:30pm or so and leave by 6pm with a general 2 hours break in between.Everyone is provided with their own cubicles and hence the working space is private for each person.There are instances of people staying up late sometimes usually during project deadlines.

Project Details: Every student is assigned a mentor for supervision of their internship. Each mentor briefs you on the project with each intern assigned to a  unique project. The difficulty of the project and the help you can expect to recieve depends solely on your mentor and hence can be a tricky part if you end up with someone who is super busy. At the end of internship you have a presentation of your project infront of the relevant team .

My project was to build a command-line tool to help extract pinout data from datasheet pdfs, represent the data in a standardized format across all manufacturers and write general analysis scripts like calculating extra number of multiplexers needed to make a microcontroller pin compatible with another and figure out a given configuration of pin-signal mapping such that all given input peripherals and some certain signals can be obtained simultaneously from MCU.

Final thoughts: Highly recommended for someone trying to a be embedded software engineer or someone interested in electrical core. Do not turn a blind eye just for low internship stipend.
