Machine Learning / Data Science intern at Sony Japan

### Internship Experience

The experience for me was too much of a learning one but a bit difficult to adapt. We worked on generative AI. We had to work in Python so it was not much of an issue but having an experience in the coding part of ML like understanding the details of implementing certain base models , knowing transfer learning and it's implementation for any custom model,etc would have helped me to be a bit faster. But the people there are too patient and they gave me sufficient time to cope up. They also focused a lot on reading and following research papers. Also the work culture is too cooperative but it also depends on who ur mentor is and what your department in Sony is. The work hours were around 8 hrs a day and we had flexibility in the start and end time of our work. The weekends were spent by visiting nearby places in Tokyo and having some local food. Overall the convenience in Japan is too good but yeah a bit disciplined nature is needed here!
