1. There are 2 parts to the intern - trading and project.  
2. The project seems data intensive and is more quant research based while trading is just pure trading (little to no relation with 'academics').  
3. I am liking the project part way more than trading. Work life balance is a big issue, especially during trading as you practically have no life outside of trading.  
4. Work environment is highly competitive, but that isnt necessarily a negative.
