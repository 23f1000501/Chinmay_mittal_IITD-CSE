The internship program is for eight weeks. 2 weeks of training followed by 6 weeks of the project.

The first week was trading training, which was common for both the trading and tech interns. Basic introduction to trading theory, things like options, ETFs, indices, greeks etc ... We had lectures, exams, discussion and market making games.

The next week was tech training. We learnt about things like testing, deploying, optiver's tech stack, coding practices, monitoring etc. 

We had some hands on tech exercises where we got familiar with optiver's internal libraries and other tools that Optiver uses.

The next 6 weeks were projects. Optiver has a lot of internal tech teams and each one of us was assigned to one tech team. We used to sit with other team members.

Each one of us had a mentor. The projects were of real utility to the team and most of them would eventually get deployed (used by traders) if finished.

For eg. My project was building a GUI for options traders in Python. My mentor was really helpful and enjoyed my time a lot.

The work life balance is great. Timings are 8:30-6:00 types with all meals in office.

There were a lot of social events at Optiver and people are pretty friendly here. Amsterdam is a great city with a lot of fun stuff to do and we often travelled around within Netherlands or to nearby countries during the weekend.
