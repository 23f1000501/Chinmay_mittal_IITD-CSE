- The internship program is for eight weeks. It includes both the learning and the project.
- During the first week, we had many different sessions and were given some pre-reads to work on. Each person was also assigned a mentor and a manager.
- The following week, we were told about our projects and their uses. There were mainly three divisions: frontend, backend, and AI. They were subdivided into more.
- We were also given a book about good coding practices that we had to go through.
- The work-life balance is good, with the timing being 10:00â€“7:00 with all the meals provided by the company.
