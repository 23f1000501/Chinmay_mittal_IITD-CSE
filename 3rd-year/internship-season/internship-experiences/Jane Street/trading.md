- Internships at Jane Street have a relatively moderate workout, you'll have something to do everyday and would be mostly busy during office hours but aren't expected to (and would never have to) work after 6 or over the weekends. 
- The work can be divided into three parts: classes, project and mock trading. 
- The classes are just for understanding how trading, markets and statistics work as you aren't expected to have much prior knowledge.
- The project work involves investigating an idea about some potential trade or hypothesis a full timer has, with the added complexity of writing programs which can help predict them. You'll be good at this if you have an understanding of data science and financial markets.
- The mock trading will be kind of like a game in which you'll have to work with 2 teammates against other interns in different situations, and the experience can range from fun to stressful
- Overall the work-life balance is pretty good, you'll have to put in some effort but you'll also get frequent company events like rock climbing or escape rooms. 
- The culture is also very casual with basically no dress codes or formalities required.
