### Coding Tests

Most technical companies having a coding test before the interviews.

The coding test will often be a Hackerrank test with **DSA/CP questions**. So preparing DSA/CP is extremely important for coding tests.

You generally have to take your laptops to the LHC for a 1 hour test.

Tests have 3/4 questions with multiple test cases and you often get points based on how many tests cases you pass or how many questions you solved completely.

It is thus advisable to submit a partially correct solution than not submitting one.

Apart from DSA questions some companies also ask questions related to C++/Python involving things like predicting the output, MCQs etc (mostly around OOPs). Some companies also ask questions related to core concepts like Computer Architecture and Networks in the hackerrank tests.

#### Difference between DSA coding tests and CP

They are pretty similar but in my opinion also very different. CP is a sport built around DSA, while the core concepts(DSA) are useful both for intern tests and CP contests.
In my opinion,
**Intern Prep = DSA prep $\neq$ CP prep**

You don't need to have a high CP rating to crack these tests(a high rating can help indirectly).

CP contests are often more difficult and mathematical and use many concepts which intern tests never target.
*So focus on the things that intern tests focus on instead of blindly giving contests/practicing on CP platforms, CP preparation is a long term thing, intern prep should be a short term focused thing*

CP contests are a good way for timed practice and seeing your overall progress compared to others and CP questions are a good way to practice slightly difficult problems.

Most companies don't care about your CP rating unless you are above Candidate Master or have done exceptionally well in ICPC.
You can have a high CP rating and not do well on their tests (you don't get shortlisted.)

PS: But with increasing competition, the best companies have shifted to asking CP type questions.
 
### DSA Resources

- [InterviewBit](https://www.interviewbit.com/)
    Best resouce in my opinion, practice topic wise questions thoroughly focussing on the important topics. Coding test questions are often just variations of the questions from here.
- [LeetCode](https://leetcode.com/)
    I recommend practicing medium/hard questions from here.
    Also great place to find past questions. Again coding test questions are often variations of the questions from here.
- [Codeforces](https://codeforces.com/)
    Best site for giving timed/rated contests and practicing past CP questions. Some companies pick questions from here directly. (Keep in mind the discussion on CP vs DSA above)
- [CP Algorithms](https://cp-algorithms.com/)
    Great site to get an idea about different Data Structures and Algorithms
- [CSES](https://cses.fi/problemset/)
    Great problem set of slightly difficult CP type questions and the accompanying book is also great


### Important Topics

- Inheritance
- Polymorphism (static/dynamic)
- Overloading
- Constructors/Destructors
- Copy Constructors
- Virtual Functions
- Encapsulation
- Abstract Classes and Interfaces
- Garbage Collection and final keyword

### General Tips

- Don't practice similar questions a lot. Read about a topic and practice questions around it till you get familiar with it
- Make sure you are comfortable with C++. Some companies only allow you to code in C++
- Make sure you practice without Code Completion, since coding platforms don't provide code completion hints
- Coding tests are a timed thing so ensure that you type fast enough
- Sometimes questions have partial points so don't hesitate submitting partially correct solutions
- Copy pasting to the HackerRank is often disabled so practice accordingly. (templates might not work)
- Don't focus on the advanced data structures and algorithms used in CP rather focus on practicing different variants of the standard things
