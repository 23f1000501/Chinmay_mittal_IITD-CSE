- Interview Process
  - Major criteria that most quant companies used for shortlisting is CGPA
  - There wasn't any test before the interview
  - Interview wasn't too long or tough
  - There were 3 back to back rounds
    - First round mostly contained questions and puzzles based on discrete maths, and some cp questions
    - Second round contained questions of probability and some oral numerical questions
    - Third round also contained questions similar to first and second round
    - As far as I remeber there weren't many advanced system specific questions based on oops, networks, or c++


- Preparation
  - For most quant roles (expect Optiver), the topics and resources to prepare are standard -
    - CP
    - Brain-teaser
    - Oral numerical questions
    - C++ concepts (if applying for system)


- Reources/tips
  - In my opinion target multiple companies and don't get obsessed on getting a particular role in a particular company
  - Don't get disheartened, as there might be some points of time where you would feel that shortlisting or selection by some company wasn't fair.
