- There were *4-5 rounds* of interviews after getting *shortlisted*
- In each one there would be an employee who would ask you some questions.
- The rounds at the beginning have multiple simpler questions about *probability* while the others involve more in-depth analysis of some probability game which involved *'market making'*.
- Market Making basically means estimating a price a contract and saying what you will buy or sell it for. 
- An example of a contract can be something like "number of aces in 10 random cards cards" and they get more complicated as the interviews progress. 
- It's not important to come to the exactly correct answer for these and just estimation works as long as you're able to explain your thought process.
- For the more complicated questions it isn't important to get a good answer in your first guess but discover the solution after discussing it with the interviewer.
