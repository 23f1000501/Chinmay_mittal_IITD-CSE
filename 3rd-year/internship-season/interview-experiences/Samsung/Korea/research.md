### CV Shortlisting

Heavy focus on CGPA and JEE Rank, top x DRs and top y JEE ranks from EE and CS were shortlisted. ~ 50 people were shortlisted

### Coding Test

an extremely easy question 
The solution was literally brute force $O(N^5)$
no knowledge of CP/DSA was required
if you can code you can probably solve the question

### Interview
- Single online interview with people from the Korea office
- Since most of their projects are ML related, the interview mostly revolved around ML
- They asked me questions about relatively standard ML topics like bagging and boosting
- There was also a 2 question form that we had to fill out before the interview. Both the questions were ML related revolving around ensemble models and feature transformations
- Discussion on my CV focusing on the ML projects and my ML knowledge

It seemed that irrespective of everything even if you didn't know ML and have a good DR/JEE rank you were selected

### Final Selection Stats

- 4 internship offers (3 CS1, 1EE)
- Selection mostly based on CGPA/JEE Rank/Test
