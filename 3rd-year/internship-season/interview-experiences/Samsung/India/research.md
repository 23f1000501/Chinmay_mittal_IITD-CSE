There were basically 3 round

1) CV shortlisting 
    - In my opinion, anyone having 7.5+ (or maybe even 7+) cg were shortlisted

2) Coding Round

    - Three questions were given.
    - Difficulty of all the questions was between Leetcode easy and Leetcode medium 
    - The test wasn't very difficult
    - Many people could easily solve it in less than half the time that was given iirc.

3) Interview Round
    - I was asked basic questions (like tell me about yourself and hobbies) 
    - Then I was asked "How would you compute $2^n$ (n can be -ve) ?" (Hint : use bit manipulation)
    - And also about the questions in the coding round. He asked me about my approach in some questions.
    - In the end he asked me about my interest in cricket which was long gone since 2015.

**Final Selection Stats**

- offers given to students from CS1, CS5, MT, EE1, EE3
