Machine Learning / Data Science intern at Sony Japan

### Interview Process

There were 2 rounds. 1st was an essay writing round where they gave us 3 questions like Why did you choose this field, what skill set/knowledge you have and why Sony and we were given a few days to write it. After that some were shortlisted for interviews and the interviews were of 30 min exactly. They just focused on 1 project/internship that you have done and asked the entire procedure, exact technical details like libraries used, dataset generation,etc.
