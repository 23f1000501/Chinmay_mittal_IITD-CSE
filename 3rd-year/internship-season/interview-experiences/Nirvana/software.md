### Internship Test

- Coding Test - one problem and multiple test cases. Time was enough, was a little bit lengthy but solvable. Had a lot of resemblence with Leetcode problems

### Prep Tips

For coding, I solved medium and hard Leetcode problems.

Later, I learned about the cp-algo website, which I wished I had known before. 
I recommend giving virtual CF contests to improve speed. 

Just do a lot of problems, including those which are out of your comfort zones and don't get intimidated by complex Data structures since they are not asked. You can learn them later once you have got a good grip on normal DS

### Final selection stats

- 3 internship offers (1 CS, 2 MnC)
- Discussion on CV during the interview and interview played a major role in selection
