### Round 1
CV shortlisting. As far as I remember this was mostly based on CGPA / JEE Ranks. Around 10 students were shortlisted. We had a dinner with previous interns and quant researchers after this.
### Round 2 
An online interview with seniors researchers. This was more of an interaction round to see our interests. We talked about the projects I had done and my experience/interest in ML. There was one question to test my understanding. It was something along the lines of a stock being traded in many markets with information about prices coming at different rates and we discussed a potential trading strategy/model for this.
### Round 3
This was an offline interview. 3-4 Medium - Hard Probability / Maths / CP questions.
One question I remember was where we were given exchange rates for different currencies and we had to devise an algorithm to see if we could make free money. For eg If 
1 USD = 100 Rupees
1 Rupee = 0.02 USD.
Then we can trade 1 USD => 100 Rupees and 50 Rupees to get back the 1 USD while earning 50 Rupees for free.
The solution was to model it as a Graph problem and detect negative cost cycles.
