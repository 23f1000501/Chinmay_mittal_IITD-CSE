Internally Tower Research is divided into several trading teams which can be considered as almost different companies.

The two trading teams that came to our campus were North-Moore and Limestone.

North-Moore is the slightly newer and smaller team which came for the Quantitative Developer role whereas Limestone is one of the oldest and largest team at Tower and came for the Quant Research role

### Round 1 (Test)

1 hr Test on HackerRank. 

I don't remember if there was a CG shortlisting round before this or not. But probably there was a shortlisting round before this based on CG. Historically Tower only gives offers to the top DRs.

The test had 3 sections as far as I remember

- 3 DSA questions (Similar to 1600-1800 rated CF problems)
    - based on Binary Search / DP / Graph algorithms
- Probability / Maths questions (similar to Brainstellar)
- Questions on C++/Python OOPs and things like Computer Architecture

The most important part in the test was the DSA section and other sections were relatively smaller and were something you knew or you didn't. I think the selection was mostly based on whether you could do the DSA questions.

The Quant Developer role also requires strong CS fundamentals and throughout the process core-CS topics were tested again and again (Comp Arch / Parallel Programming / DSA etc.)

### Round 2 (Interview)

Mostly focussed on DSA. The interviewer had a list of medium/hard questions from LeetCode and was directly asking questions from there.

He then started asking probability puzzles similar to Medium-Hard Brainstellar ones

He then went through my CV and I had mentioned using Pandas in a previous internship so he started asking me questions about Pandas

### Round 3 (Interview)

This was more focussed on other CS core topics

I remember being asked questions about:

- Parallel Programming. 
    - Calculate sum and prefix sum of an array of n elements using p threads and also compute the time complexity

- Computer Architecture
    - He gave me a piece of C++ code. Asked me why it was ineffecient which involved things like branch prediction in the assembly code and then asked me how can I rewrite it effeciently

- DSA
    - He asked me something along the lines of how to sort an extremely large array with limited RAM

There were many more questions of this kind that I don't remember
