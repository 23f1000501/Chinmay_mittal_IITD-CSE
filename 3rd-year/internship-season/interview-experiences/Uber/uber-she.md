- Since I am a dual degree student, not many companies were open during the OCS internship season in my third year. 
- I applied for Uber's She++ program in late February which is there for 2nd year BTech and 3rd year Dual Degree females.
- 75 candidates were selected out of 2500 who had applied from around 15 colleges of India based on a coding test and CV.
- The test comprised of 3 CP problems, to be done in 1 hour. - Both speed and accuracy in these problems matter.
- If you have a decent knowledge of data structure fundamentals and are familiar with the standard DP, stacks and recursion problems, this round should be smooth for you. - The 75 candidates selected were invited to Uber's Hyderabad office where there was a day of fireside chats by Uber leaders and some fun activities. Accommodation, travel and food was all arranged by Uber
- Right after this event we got mails for interviews. All 75 students were eligible to sit for interviews for Uber's STAR intern role (similar to SDE).
- The interview was held in April first week and was 30 minute long. Questions related to my projects on CV, DSA as well as certain HR questions were asked in the interview. - - One week later, I received a mail that stated that I was among 29 selected candidates for the internship this summer. - The interview can be easily cracked with a decent knowledge of DSA fundamentals and on the spot promptness and smartness in tackling the interviewer's questions about your CV particularly.
- Since I had projects from courses like AI and Computer networks on my CV the interviewer went on to ask me questions about some basic concepts of these topics too. 
- One important advice would be to not fake your skills/projects on your CV as the interviewer looks at it very carefully and can grill you on those.
