# Uber Interview Experience

## Written Tests
- There was only a single round of tests with 4-5 problems (exact number uncertain).
- Uber employs a partial points system for their problems.
- For example, if you pass 8 out of 10 test cases, you receive 80% of the points associated with the problem.
- Unlike other companies where partial solves were viewed negatively compared to full solves, here the partial solves are proportional.
- Hence, there isn't much point in trying to improve or correct your code if you have already earned a significant chunk of points.
- **Note:** Even the sample test cases had points associated with them, so make sure to include code that prints the sample test cases for some easy brownie points! ðŸ˜„
- If I were to rate the difficulty level of the problems (based on Codeforces rating), I would estimate it to be around 1500 - 1900.
- The total points were approximately 600, and the cutoff for the interview was around 350 points.

## Interview Rounds

### Round 1: Programming Round
- The first round consisted of a programming challenge where you had to write a program for a problem provided by the interviewers.
- The interviewers could see your code editor on their laptops, allowing them to view all the code you wrote.
- It was crucial to think aloud and explain your approach since the questions were somewhat challenging and the interviewers were really helpful,
  they corrected me whenever I was diverging from the correct approach.
- Receiving hints from the interviewers proved helpful, and it also tested your ability to communicate and accept feedback.
- You were free to use any common programming language.
- The interviewers also emphasized the importance of clean and well-explained code.
- I had hardly practiced from leetcode and mostly stuck to codeforces for practicing competitive programming.
  So later, upon discussion with friends, Interestingly I discovered that the problem I was asked during this round was actually 
  from LeetCode: [Bus Routes](https://leetcode.com/problems/bus-routes/).

### Round 2: High-Level Design Round
- The second round focused on high-level system design, where you had to implement and design a system based on a description provided by the interviewers.
- Clean, efficient, and well-explained code remained crucial in this round.
- It was important to thoroughly understand the problem by actively engaging with the interviewers and seeking clarifications on their requirements.
- Similar to the previous round, this problem was also sourced from LeetCode: [Design Movie Rental System](https://leetcode.com/problems/design-movie-rental-system/).

### Round 3: HR Round
- The third round delved into a more personal aspect through an HR interview.
- During this round, I was asked about my projects, my knowledge of Uber, and the reasons why I aspired to join the company.
- Furthermore, I was questioned about any conflicts I had encountered during group work and how I resolved them.
- The primary objective of this round was to assess my compatibility with the company culture and evaluate my ability to interact effectively with others.

Overall, the Uber interview process encompassed three rounds, including a written test, programming round, high-level design round, and HR round. 
It provided a valuable opportunity to showcase technical skills, problem-solving abilities, effective communication, and cultural alignment.

### Final Selection Stats

- 3 internship offers (1 ME1, 1MT1, 1EE1 ; exclusive of Uberstar selections)
- Selection was mostly about being good at Competetive Programming
- CGPA cut off 6.5
