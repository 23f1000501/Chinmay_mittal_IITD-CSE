### Interview Process

2 rounds 
- 1st - online test - consists of 3 parts aptitude, core ee, coding 
- 2nd - online interview - asked about my projects and some electrical engineering concepts 

### Prep Tips

For the core EE role - have some hands-on-experience projects, this will be very beneficial. Your core (ELL202, ELL201, ELL304, ELL305) concepts must be very clear(revise the course content and Youtube channel like Neso Academy etc is sufficent).
Also, don't ignore the coding stuff, that too is required (easy to medium level), and leetcode, interview bit is sufficient.

### Final Offer Stats

- 7 internship (5 hardware (all in EE) + 2 software (all in CS))
- 7.5 CGPA cutoff
- Selection was mostly based on interviews where quite some time was devoted to project discussion
