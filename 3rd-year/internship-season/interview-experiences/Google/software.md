## Interview Experience
- Round 1: Screening test, 2 coding questions
- Round 2: Coding Interview, 1 question (Bit manipulation)
- Round 3: Coding Interview, 1 question (Graph theory and dp)

## Suggested resources/tips
- Topic wise practice on Interview Bit (mainly for dp, tree traversal, graph theory) - for good hold on topic and getting the concepts clear.
- Top ~100 questions on Leetcode (mostly Easy and Medium out of them) - to skim through the frequently asked and famous algo problems.
- Codeforces contests (div 2 & div 3) - to track the improvement in performance and speed.
