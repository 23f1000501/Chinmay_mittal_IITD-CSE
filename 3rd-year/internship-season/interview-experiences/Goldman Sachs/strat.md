### Interview Process

2 kinds of interviews: Technical and Quant. You'll give either one, or both. In Technical they ask CP kind of questions, but pretty basic, mainly Graphs/Trees. In quant, essentially probability and other brainstellar kind of questions. I didn't have an HR round but some people did.
