### Internship Test

By Atif Anwer
The interview only had one round. The first part had three DSA problems (greedy, dp(binary tree cameras), and graphs(bellman ford alg)). In the next part, I was asked to talk about one of my research projects.

Select one area of interest and be good at it. I had decided that software was the one, and I invested myself to get good at competitive programming. Make sure to polish your CS fundamentals and knowledge in C++ and Python (OOPS & compile time optimizations).
