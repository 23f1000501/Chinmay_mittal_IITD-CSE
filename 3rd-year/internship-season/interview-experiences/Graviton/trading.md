### Interview Process

Resume shortlist, subjective test, followed by 2 interview rounds. The test is the most crucial part.   Probably the only HFT with a subjective test, maths concepts are checked in depth. The questions cover a wide variety: especially probability, discrete maths.

### Prep

I had targeted quant companies. Covered the basic books & sites suggested for quant prep. For interviews specifically, I asked seniors for mock interviews to get some tips which were very helpful. Main courses I revised & were helpful: COL106, MTL106, MTL180. I also attempted firm specific tests available online for foreign trading firms. 

### Final offer stats

- 2 offers both in MnC
- 8.5 CGPA cutoff
- scholastic achievments, test and JEE rank were mostly the criterion for selection
