### Interview Process
80 in 8 
80 math arithmetic questions (mcq) in 8 minutes, fairly simpler than what you find online.

9 Neuro games
Games involving memory, decision-making, speed, etc. Some people preferred having a mouse there for speed. Couldn't find any resources for practice (other than mobile games ofc)

GD
market making game, read the hand-out and get familiar with the terms they use. Playing some sample games and coming up with a strategy is recommended. There was also a strategy building game, where people were divided into break out rooms, and had to discuss their game strategy. Participation matters.

Online interviews before day 1
Again market making this time 1 on 1 with a trader, along with puzzles. You need to be quick on you estimates, and provide a fair enough reasoning for your answers.
