- The Group Discussion is only for the Trading Role
- GD will mostly involve trading games

- It is important that you speak even if you don't have the best points to make, staying quiet the whole time doesn't do you any good
- Also making stupid points and being the loudest etc. doesn't help
- There are no right answers/best trading strategies so instead of wasting your time thinking of the best solutions, adapt to what other people are doing, argue why their strategies are not good and suggest better strategies
- Be polite while arguing against others
- Explain why you suggest something instead of just making your points
- Get familiar with Market Making and also practice mock games with your friends

PYQs

Market Making

Trading Game

 - 3 Teams of 4 people, there are 6 castles with values 1-6, you have 100 guards, and you have to assign certain number of guards to each castle if you have the highest number of guards in a particular castle than you win that castle and get the corresponing points, decide your allocation
 - What would you do if the value of a castle will be doubled randomly decided by a dice roll after your allocation

 Remember that trading games often don't have a best strategy and often a good strategy depends on seeing what others are doing and improvising accordingly.
 
 Stratgies which take other's action into account are highly appreciated. 
 
 Finding Mathematically superior strategies is difficult in the limited time available so in my opinion don't waste a lot of time on proving things mathematically because it is highly unlikely that such a strategy exists


Basic Market Making Tips

- Develop a rough estimate of the theoretical value
- Your bid and ask should be around that theo, if your theo is 100 than your bid will be 100 - x and your ask would be 100 + y where x and y depend on your confidence and willingness to buy and sell
- Your theo should adapt seeing what trades others are making and estimating their theo
- Don't take too long/short positions if you are not confident about your theo
- Taking positions is suggested only if you are confident about your theo and if that is the case a great way to make money is to provide a narrow spread around the theo
- Arbitrage is a typical strategy in beginner games so be quick to react to the markets other people make. Arbitrage is in layman's terms is buying low and selling high exploting inefficiencies in market by being quick to react 
- Practice with your friends before the final day
- Be familiar with the terms involved bid/ask/offer/yours/mine/quote/trade/spread etc.
