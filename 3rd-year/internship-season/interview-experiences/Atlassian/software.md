### Interview process

Firstly there was a coding round, I don't remember the exact time given but there was 3 questions. I believe all three were doable in the given time frame if you have a CF rating of 1400+.
The interview had two rounds, one technical and the other values and management round.
The technical round mostly was about data structures and a Competitive programming question. Mine was mainly based around maps implementation and it's use.
The values and management round is taken quite seriously at Atlassian. The company has five basic values(you can check on its website). The interviewer frames the questions in such a way to find if you have showcased any of those values at any point in your life.

### Prep tips

For coding test, practice DP, Binary search and graph questions well. If you sit for Atlassian interview, definitely check out the values given in the company's website and try to incorporate those in your answers and stories
