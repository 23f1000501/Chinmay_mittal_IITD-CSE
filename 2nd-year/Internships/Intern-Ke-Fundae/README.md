# Minutes of Intern ke Fundae Session August'23

*ACES-ACM IITD* organized the *2nd-3rd year* interaction session ‚ÄòIntern ke Fundae‚Äô at LH318 on *29th Aug 2023*. Following are the minutes of the event prepared by Purushottam, Jahnabi, Anuj and Akshat for people of CS&E IITD.

### Why Intern?

- IITD NGU Design Credits for 2nd year Summer Intern
    * Completing design credits is a degree requirement
    * How you choose to complete these credits it upto you, refer to [Courses of Study](https://home.iitd.ac.in/uploads/course-of-study/IITD-CoS-2022-23-for-Web.pdf) for more information
- Travelling opportunities
- Fun experience
- Learn technical things / soft-skills with real hands-on experience
- Great CV point
- Networking opportunity
- Some interns also provide a stipend (monetary compensation)

### Where?

- SURA - Under a professor @IITD-Limited spots
    * This is a recogonized research program
    * You receive a project grant and project stipend
    * You receive a formal recoginition from IITD for completing SURA
    * Limited spots and selection process, only one team under one professor
    * Visit [IRD](https://ird.iitd.ac.in/content/summer-undergraduate-research-award-sura) for more info
- Informal Project under some professor in IITD or some other university
- Open Source Development - GSoC, SWE Projects etc.
- Work @ Startup - Use LinkedIn / Contacts / Cold email startups, PoCs and get an opportunity to intern at a startup or work on nascent codebases
- Indian Institutes Profs - IISc, IISERs, IITs, ISI, CMI (Math and Theory CS people generally go here)
- Corporate interns via OCS - Phase I (Jane Street) done. Watch out for Phase 2 interns. For CS5 people, remember that you can only avail OCS intern twice (3rd and 4th year interns are more valuable)
- Corporate intern through self - Startups!- You‚Äôll get a lot to learn. Keep realistic expectations. Connect with startups and people on LinkedIn
- Off-Campus
    * Keep realistic expectations
    * You might not get many responses in your second year
- Match your interests with prof, Look at their work and approach if common interest base
- University Programs by Tech Companies (especially for girl students) -UBER (She++), Microsoft (Engage), Flipkart (GRID), Google (STEP)
- University Research programs - Formal application in contrast to cold emailing a prof. More structured. Example - EPFL, MITACS, MPI, ETH-Zurich. Visit [This page](https://github.com/himahuja/Research-Internships-for-Undergraduates) for more info

### CV Preparation Tips

- Make it Professional - Make a LaTeX CV on Overleaf! Easy to learn
- Sections- College CGPA and School, Scholastic Achievements (JEE Rank, Olympiads, KVPY, NTSE, Top 7%), Course Projects / Projects (COL106-DSA COL215 : frame the assignments as Course Projects), Courses Done, Technical Skills (HTML/CSS are not programming languages :P, keep these small things in mind). Write the things relevant to the prof/companies you are targeting, make multiple CVs for different fields if needed
- Work Experience - Again, write relevant things (For Research Intern, professors look more into projects done than here). If you have done something after first year, include it here
- Keep it one page
- Keep it relevant to the domain and make it parallel and aligned to the field you‚Äôre applying to.
- [BSW Samples](https://bsw.iitd.ac.in/Placement_Talks-master/homepage/foreign_intern/foreign_intern.html)
- Get it reviewed from your peers and seniors

### Foreign Research Intern

- First, find out about your interests
- Find professors- [CS Rankings](https://csrankings.org) (Don‚Äôt go straight for the top ones)
- Explore research program [here](https://github.com/himahuja/Research-Internships-for-Undergraduates)

### Talks


#### Amish Kansal (SURA)

- An e-mail will come from SURA quite late, most probably next year around January to submit project proposals
- Structured framework with Stipend and Project Grant
- It‚Äôll include and ask for a project proposal and a faculty supervisor
- You‚Äôll get a certificate at the end if your project meets the expectations of the SURA committee
- Amish‚Äôs work was in ML
- Do the relevant course, higher chances of acceptance.
- Please clear the TnC on the project (do this to avoid friction between professor and 3rd year internship season)
- Don‚Äôt have to make a CV - suggested that look for a prof from your department or related - for example, Amish worked under Chetan Arora with a project with AIIMS on ML.
- Chose a field of your interest - Very Important!! - Those who didn‚Äôt, suffered
- Express your expectations from the project to the professor early on
- Especially for CS5, you can save your OCS card for later
- You need to be ready with expressing what you‚Äôve done in the relevant field - basically, the topic on which the project is based upon, say ML
- An informal project can be turned to be brought under SURA, so if you find a prof in December, you can bring that under SURA later on or you can take another project under the prof under SURA
- You can extend your SURA to COD for CS1 peeps.
- SURA presentation committee sits in around October and determines whether the project was succesful.

---

#### Aditya Gupta (Hybrid - Corporate Intern)

- You‚Äôll improve your interpersonal/time management/communication skills via a corporate intern which you don‚Äôt get to learn much via a research intern. These skills help heavily especially in HR round in interviews.
- Networking - Improve your LinkedIn profile, start sending out connection requests (without a note), you can ask them for a referral once you are comfortable with them asking about their work experience-mostly alumni (initially)
- Sir got to connect with a technical lead at Google
- Startups - small or decent ones are the only ones that offer you now, not the giants
- Skills - CP, DSA, HR-in the interviews - The first two, everyone develops, the last-only via corporate interns
- You get to learn about their hierarchy, communication is important
- Look for this aside from research intern
- ‚ÄúListen to all but karo khud ki finally‚Äù

---

#### Suren (INRIA - Research Intern)

- Suren worked on Clustering algorithms
- Apply to work in a topic that you actually want to work in. Don‚Äôt be scared of the prereqs. Nobody expects a second year undergrad to know everything (You only have a very general curriculum)
- Avoid the topics that don‚Äôt interest you
- 8-10 team size is the ideal size to work in, Larger than that gets clumsy
- Mass mailing <<<< Targeted mailing-At least have a look at the prof‚Äôs home page before mailing
- Include details about yourself, don‚Äôt repeat points form CV, try to be as real as possible (real), don‚Äôt express desperation, try to highlight a few academic achievements, highlight the fact that you are interested to pursue research in the future-at least you want to explore it
- Most of you‚Äôll (CS1 peeps) do Corporate interns in your 3rd year so why not try research once before that
- You also get a chance to prove your parents that you can live outside India
- Programs- MPI (September-very low chance for sophomores), MITACS (3rd year), programs mostly are not open for sophomores so best look for profs to do an intern under on your own

---

#### Mani Sarthak (IISc)

- If you delay your applications, your only option is doing your intern inside India as VISA and all the processes take time
- Start mailing early - Again, targeted mailing is better than mass mailing. Luck matters. Arranging for accommodation and travel gets tough if you get late. Get your passport and documents ready!
- Offline - more work but you learn work ethics and social skills.
- Spare yourself some time to prepare for the upcoming internship next semester
- Mention that you want to learn and will, not that you‚Äôve learnt, don‚Äôt procrastinate over the fact that you‚Äôll learn

---

#### Sanya Mittal (CMU - Online + non-SURA IITD Project)

- The CMU intern was semester intern, then she went on to do online intern at IITD itself
- Try out research intern, to make your views clear about research.
- Again, interests matter - Sanya worked on Discrete Maths was what she liked
- Avoid mass mailing, look interested in your mail
- Personalize your CV and mention the specific projects you wanna do under him
- Do read their faculty page for their research
- If you‚Äôre sure about corporate interns in mind, make sure you keep time for that (or at least keep that in mind while making a decision as summers is all you get to prepare)
- Sanya was asked to submit a report of his(prof‚Äôs) papers relating to the research work
- Online - You can‚Äôt discuss about the work with peers much but get time to prepare for the corporate interns coming up
- Active profs introduce you to the ongoing research work
- For SURA, prof and student both have to be on campus
- Ma'am did the non-SURA IITD project under Prof. Venkata in IITD and since he was travelling, could not offer SURA but she was very much interested in the field. So didn't drop the project.
- Prioritize your interests.
- Keep mail as name.iitd.cse@gmail.com for emailing via gmail

#### Anish Banerjee (NUS-Offline)

- Worked on Quantum Computing
- Got the intern via OCS in March - Phase 2 recruitment (Look out for these opportunities)
- Did a reading project in the first year summers-highlighted this in the CV
- Read and presented research papers on ‚ÄúQuantum Supremacy‚Äù
- Via this, also got to improve his network
- Start mailing now !!!
- Do drop reminder mails to the prof (2-3 reminder mails)
- Apply to the programs as well like Max Planck, EPFL-even those which require 3 years of study
- Try to connect not just with Indians, but with locals as well. Make local and global connections.
- Try at places where alum work/have worked
- Again interest is importantüòá
- While studying something related to the topic you are applying (eg. ML and Quantum Computing), try to make LaTeX notes to leave an impression on the prof relating to your dedication and attach to the mail.

#### Sarwagya Prasad (ANU-Mathematical Logic and NTU-NLP)

- Both online interns
- You get to explore academia via research interns
- Good CV point and get to explore foreign lands (in offline internships)
- Don‚Äôt sacrifice your preparation for the 3rd year intern
- If taking multiple interns, choose both online, even one offline one online won‚Äôt work
- Do prepare a CV, nobody knows much now so don‚Äôt worry
- Keep a track of deadlines of university programmes.
- Start mailing now, since it takes some time to get a response even.
- Programs aren‚Äôt for 2nd year mostly, but do try and be on the lookout for their deadlines
- In Germany, NTU, NUS there is a lot of programs. Apply for Australian, Singaporean universities since they have a higher rate of accepting project.
- Professors sometimes block institute mail ids as they get a lot of spam so do make a new Gmail id for the mailing purpose
- Pick universities better in QS rankings, do consult seniors
- Do take a look at the prof‚Äôs faculty page before emailing
- Pick profs in field of your interest
- Include your introduction in the mail, show your interest in the prof‚Äôs work(takes quite some time)-don‚Äôt waste much time-just look for their field-don‚Äôt go on to read research papers every time as you‚Äôve a lot of profs to mail
- Try going for a junior professor/associate professor/assistant professor when applying for interns since they have a higher chance of accepting your mail, because they are generally looking for interns to work at their labs. Experienced professors tend to work with experienced UGs/Masters/Phd students
- Ask seniors for CV and cover letter samples
- Try to schedule the mail to match the prof‚Äôs local time
- Try that you get an offline research intern
- Online has freedom of work
- Even if you get a positive response from a prof, don‚Äôt stop mailing
- If doing online, try for two this way you can explore more

#### Kavya Chopra (Corporate - UBER)

- Kavya explored both CP and Dev - liked both
- On the basis of which, she decided that corporate intern would be the one for her
- Three Rounds - CP, Machine Code, HR Round
- After the interview, they disclosed that they had opened it for Second Yearites by mistake
- If you are asked to sit for an intern in phase-2 or are selected for an intern, you have to or else get debarred by OCS
- Worked in the risk team in UBER
- 2 out of 5 days was compulsory for work-intern environment was really good. Excellent work culture. Collaborative team.
- Didn‚Äôt enjoy the work-had high expectations but got disappointed. Just had a simple implementation of changing color of a button after specific time intervals.
- Suggestion - Research Intern > Corporate Intern now since you get more time for 3rd Year Intern Prep, also there is a good chance that a friend will be with you, more travelling opportunities
- Do independent self-projects(makes you stand apart from the crowd), helpful in landing projects with professors in fields ‚Üí ML, systems, theoretical CS
- Ask your seniors for the self-projects
- CP is very important for Corporate interns-CF,  LeetCode-Keep doing in general. Be regular.
- Dev experience does help but not hard and fast

---

#### Kushagra Gupta (Offline - INRIA)

- If you had been interested in anything beforehand, try it
- Just read the research papers of the profs relating to the category
- Do mention how much you are interested by mentioning your past achievements in the field
- Skeleton: Intro, experience, academic background, express interest.
- Charpak and ETH offer programmes and scholarships. Try and get these if possible.

### QnA

1. **How to find topics?**
- Broad List of Topics
    * Theorical Computer Science
        * Algorithms
        * Cryptography
        * Logic and Program Verification
    * Systems
        * Computer Architecture / Hardware
        * Networks
        * Security
        * Databases
        * Programming Languages
        * Operating Systems
        * Compilers
        * Mobile Computing / Embedded Systems
        * High performance and distributed systems
    * AI/ML
        * NLP
        * Theoritical ML
        * Computer Vision
        * Robotics
        * Data Mining / Information Retrieval
    * Others
        * Graphics
        * Human Computer Interaction
        * Computational chemistry/biology
        * CS applications in Economics/Management


Kavya & Sanya - Theoretical CS Topics-Take an overview of what the work will be with the prof
Sarwagya - Think about the broad topics for now, the prof will give you reading assignments to get to know more
Sanya - You don‚Äôt know now if you‚Äôll end up liking it, just be curious and don‚Äôt go by FOMO

Choose a few topics that you find interesting, learn a little more about them and narrow down to a couple of topics abd then start approaching relevant professors

2. **Difference between CV and Cover Letter?**
Sanya - Cover letter is the email CV is a document highlighting your background and skills that you send with the email
3. **How much is the weightage of the Research Intern/2nd year intern for 3rd year interns?**
Aditya - Keep doing CP, learn DSA properly irrespective of your second year intern, the interpersonal skills you gain there will help you in the third year intern as they look for the good HR skills
Mani - For third year OCS interns 1st round is CV shortlisting, 2nd round is Technical, 3rd round is where the HR finally gets to know about the intern you did, until then the company doesn‚Äôt get to see your work, so internships do give you an edge for this round. Keep doing CP irrespective of your intern. 
Suren - In HR round, you get to have a talking point due to this intern as they ask you about the projects you have done in the past as you might not have done many self projects but you had a two month long internship to tell about. 
Sarwagya - ML projects do help you get shortlisted, but it isn‚Äôt much helpful for SDE interns in future, helps you explore your interest, especially if ML is involved
Sanya - Dropping the intern and preparing for the 3rd year Intern is always an option
Chinmay - Helps remove blank spaces from your CV and gives you talking points during interviews, for those people interested in applying to research in the future or trying offcampus, 2nd year intern can be really useful
Aditya - CG is a big factor in OCS shortlisting, if CG is not much like me, you should try for research interns/off campus interns for which second year intern is important
4. **How to figure out your interests?**
Sanya - If you have a lead, go for the universities that offer it, otherwise ML is a good point to start with
Sarwagya - At least take a look at their main works i.e. the headings as in the end the prof‚Äôs gonna offer you a project of his choice, pre-knowledge is not much needed
Kavya - Maths and CS are the two main topics CS students like, Andrew Ng‚Äôs course is good, If you liked COL100 and COL106 much, CS is the one for you, if COL215 is what you liked, then hardware is the thing for you, ML is more related to interest in maths
5. **How is this summer different for CS1 and CS5?**
Chinmay - Many companies remain closed for CS5 in even 3rd year intern, OCS rule-You don‚Äôt get to do off-campus in the companies that come on-campus, your 3rd year CV would be flagged. So CS5 people generally have an extra year to explore compared to CS1 people before they sit for OCS interns
Kavya - Do read OCS policies, don‚Äôt compromise CG at any cost
Aditya - Do pick useful courses in 4th semester onwards as it‚Äôll increase your chances of getting an intern later on, maintain a good CGPA
6. **Resources for OCS interns?**
- Will be covered in a session later
- Broadly visit LeetCode/Codeforces to get an idea of CP and Brainstellar to get an idea of Quant prep

7. **Good CG**
- The more the better
- Most companies have a thereshold of not more than 8.5, so 8.5 + is a good CGPA
- Very few companies have a thereshold of 9+/9.5+
- Many software companies have a thereshold of 7+
- You know your current CGPA, and you know how much you can improve keep trying to get it above the next threshold, people with CGPA below 8 try to get it to 8+, people with CGPA between 8-8.5 try to get it to 8.5+ and so on.

#### Demo

- csrankings.org
You get to choose the topics and institutions, even by country and timeline of publications
Start a bit lower on the list
Australia, Singapore, Europe should be priority as the travel cost is lower so more chances of offline intern
Mail carefully!!
- Mails
Attach the link for CV, not the PDF itself as many universities put the mails with attachments in spam. 
Don‚Äôt write an entire story about your background be short and crisp
- CV
    * Do run the CV on Grammarly for the common mistakes
    * Keep the spacing good for a professional CV.  
    * Line to line should be covered horizontally
    * Describe your work properly. Use crisp and technical words to describe your assignments as projects done. 
    * Get it reviewed by the seniors, amongst yourselves
    * POR, ECA are not so important for Research Interns and even if you wanna mention, mention the ones that are more technically oriented
    *  Prioritize the post 10th/12th class achievements unless you have very exceptional ones from before
