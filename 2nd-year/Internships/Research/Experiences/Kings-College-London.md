- Remote intern at **King's college London**
- Topic: **Neural Networks**
- Professor: **Prof. Fredrik Maillmann-Trenn**

### Experience

Experience was decent. Intern was pretty chill, workload was light. The professor provided me with two of his research papers, whose algorithms I had to implement in python and make a GUI out of it. The intern was unpaid.

Mass mailing from csrankings.org

### Tips
Mass mail large number of professors, don't be disheartened if you don't receive any reply since many people usually have to mail to 100-200 professors in order to get a reply. Keep in touch with your batchmates about the replies they receive and definitely mail those professors who have responded positively to a batchmate.
