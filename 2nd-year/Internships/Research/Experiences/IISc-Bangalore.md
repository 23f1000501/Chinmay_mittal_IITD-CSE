- Topic **Machine Learning**
- Professor **Prof. Gaurab Banerjee**

### Experience
The experience was highly positive, and the research group provided exceptional support. Our work involved detecting Human Gait using on-chip Frequency Modulated Continuous Wave (FMCW) radars. This project was carried out in collaboration with DRDO, which led to regular Monday meetings with senior DRDO officials to brief them on the ongoing progress. My focus was on the machine learning aspect, which included tasks such as classifying different gaits and exploring biomedical applications like fall detection—a critical concern for the elderly.

In addition to the state-of-the-art facilities available at IISc (I even gained access to their supercomputer within hours), the individuals there were incredibly supportive and willing to offer assistance. The IISc campus is really beautiful , and Bangalore's climate is delightful—feels like heaven when compared to Delhi. It provided ample opportunities to explore the surrounding areas. Fun fact: whenever you go outside campus, every second person you meet will be of the IT community !

### How did you get your intern ?
IISc's departmental websites to search for professors and their About page/ Bio to get the research topic for intern :)

### Tips
I started mailing very late, beginning in April end 2023 (just before 4th semester Majors). Also, I lacked a passport at that point, so I reached out exclusively to professors at IISc. Initially, I wanted to secure an internship in  probability or cryptography; however, I didn't got any reply. Then, I expanded my search to professors woking in machine learning. Interestingly, I reached out to just two professors, and remarkably, both of them extended offers for the internship.

Moral : It is easiest to get an intern in ML domain because most professors in circuital domain are working on it. 

Also try to apply early so that you have the time left to discuss the accomodation and expenses involved.
