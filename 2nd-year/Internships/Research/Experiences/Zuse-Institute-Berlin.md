- Research Intern at *Zuse Institute Berlin, Germany*
- Topic: **Optimization and Learning**
- Professor: **Ksenia Bestuzheva / SCIP team, IOL Lab**

### Experience

- My work involved more of implementation and testing than research (they gave a choice between research and computation in the interview). The experience was overall great. - The workload was not at all hectic and the timings were also pretty relaxed which left plenty of time to explore other European cities and also prepare for 3rd year internship season.  - We weren’t expected to know much about their work/field of research beforehand or during the interview. Before the internship, they gave some simple preparatory material to acquaint us with some topics (like Branch and Bound method and SCIP solver in my case). Also, my 1st week of intern involved my supervisor tutoring me on Optimisation and Mixed Integer Programming. - The supervisors and otherwise Berlin people were quite welcoming and helpful. Most of the people there were comfortable talking in English which was quite a relief.  - Feel free to contact in case of any doubts

### How did you get your intern ?

- I got to know about ZIB from one of my seniors (he had worked as an intern there, the previous year) who had a nice experience in Berlin
- I studied some basics of optimisation (Linear programming mainly), linear regression and gradient descent algorithm and revisited the course material for Calculus, Vectors and Linear Algebra (MTL100 and MTL101).

### Tips

For mailing
- Initially, try to send personalised mails to professors/researchers researching in field you have interest or experience in. Try to make the cover letter concise and highlight the points in it that are relevant to the topic you are applying for. Also, you can mention some research work or paper they published (don’t forget to study a bit about it before the interview). 
- Don't forget to get your CV and Cover Letter reviewed by multiple seniors.
For the interview
- Be confident and polite during interview and prepare a 2 to 3 minutes long introduction (explaining your skills, hobbies and technical/research background) beforehand. Look up for some important topics and term in the field of research you have applied for and also, their applications in real life. Also, try to look up a bit about the research background of the person you are interviewing with.
