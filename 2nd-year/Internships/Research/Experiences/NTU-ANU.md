- Research Intern at (Online) **UNSW**
- Topic **Mathematical Logic**

### Experience
I did two online research intern, one in Speech Lab of NTU (part of a team of 3 to find LLM driven ways for ITN), and one sort of independently with an Emeritus Prof from ANU (Build an automatic Prover for modal logic, and write a paper on the same). Being online definitely allows you to work on two interns together, and I found that I am very interested in the ANU project while did not like the work in the NTU project. Since I was not bound by any, I left the NTU project midway, but am continuing ANU intern still, and plan on doing it alongside the semester.

### How did you get your intern ?
Mailed professors - found on university pages from csrankings.com

### Tips
Start mailing NOW. Regardless of whether your friends are doing it.
Look out for university programs (although those are hard to get in for 2nd years)
Offline intern requires a big window for processes - keep this in mind

You may want to approach a research intern slightly differently depending on what your aim is - if you want to explore academia and research, start early and get interns where the topic or area of research is something you are actually interested in. For this aim, online vs offline does not make that much difference, but obviously offline intern is a better experience and more immersive, while in online you could pursue two projects. If given a choice though, I would have preferred offline :)
Otherwise if you want to do a intern because you don't have other stuff to do etc., you might prefer fields where you already have some skills in, so that you can also focus on ocs intern prep. Although most of the times you will not get multiple to have a choice.

Either way, you need not stop when you get a confirmation from one source. CONTINUE mailing, you may get a better opportunity.
