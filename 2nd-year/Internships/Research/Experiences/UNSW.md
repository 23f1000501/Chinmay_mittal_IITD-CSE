- University Research Intern at UNSW
- Topic **Neural network models** 
- Prof. **Sahani Pathiraja**

### Experience

Didn't get a proper intern vibe as it was online but still learned some thing but chat GPTing things and got the time to prepare for third year intern as well . Not much guidance was given by the professor, meets were organized once in a fortnight. A latex report was maintained to check the work progress and the intern was concluded by a presentation. Initially prof gave a research paper and based on that I had to modify an existing code. Topic was Opinion Dynamics Modelling which combined ODEs with neural network. 

### How did you get your intern

I mailed the professor around February.

### Tips

Start mailing from September onwards. Find professors from csrankings.org
