- Project at IITD
- Topic **Security in Drone Communication**
- Professor **Vireshwar Kumar**

### Experience
It was nice experience. I also continued it as a COD310 project next semester.

### How did you get your intern ?
Mailed the professor showing him my interest in security 

### Tips
For project, if can mail the professor by mentioning them that you want to work in this area of your interest if he is also working in that area. Also it's better if you can look through his website to get a view on what type of project he works and ask yourself is it really that interest you?
