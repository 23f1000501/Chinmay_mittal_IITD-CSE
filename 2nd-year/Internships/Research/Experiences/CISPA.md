### Experience
I thoroughly enjoyed my time as a summer research intern at CISPA. It was a truly enriching experience for me as I learned to navigate and manage various aspects of life in a foreign country. This opportunity taught me valuable skills such as cooking, grocery shopping, and efficient travel, in addition to my primary research responsibilities.

The program allowed for plenty of free time to explore the city and its surroundings, which was particularly appealing to me as an avid traveler. Over almost every weekend, I had the chance to visit around 6 neighboring countries, indulging my passion for exploration.

Regarding my research contributions:
- I applied Greybox grammar fuzzing to overcome constraints and generate inputs that were both semantically and syntactically valid.
- I employed evolutionary algorithms to progressively refine and improve the input population. This approach capitalized on the potential of ISLa-generated inputs and mutation strategies to optimize fitness, resulting in remarkable outcomes.

### How did you get your intern ?
I went through the cover letter of seniors and read about the current research of the professor.

### Tips
Customize your emails and search for programs in which professors are seeking interns. Write about your interests in the cover letter, explaining why you're interested in pursuing a research internship. Emphasize key points in your cover letter, and avoid duplicating information already present in your CV. If possible, include letters of recommendation from professors or supervisors you have worked with; these can greatly benefit your application.
