### Tips
For cracking coding interviews bare minimum try to solve the striver sheet. Along with that try coding contests on leetcode or codeforces depending on how good you want to be.(codeforces hard) Learn simple languages like sql, R too and try to know a few libraries of python that can help in quick calculations like matrix multiplication or others that come to mind.
