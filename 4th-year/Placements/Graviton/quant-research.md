### Selection Process

1) Written Test (Discrete Maths, CP based) - 4 questions 1 hour, had to write (semi) formal proofs
2) 3 Interview Rounds (unofficial - not through OCS) before Day 1, focusing mainly on math problems, slight weightage to internship project was also given, also had a random CP question in one interview, but I guess that depends on your interviewer
3) Personally I did not have an interview on day 1, but many others did

### Other Stats

- There were at least 8 shortlisted on Day 1 that I know of , but this number will almost certainly be higher. Finally there were 3 offers.
- All 3 offers were from CS1.
- CG Cutoff 8
- Interviews were the main selection criterion
